# Text Editor From Scratch

Simplistic text editor for Windows only for now. Inspired by Kilo editor which was written in C and written in C++.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a terminal based text editor from scratch using Windows API and also by implementing low level terminal control, screen rendering using escape codes and a buffer system for text manipulation.

## Features

* **Syntax Highlighting**: When given a specific filetype, highlights programming language syntax and literals
* **Search Functionality**: Incremental search that allows users to locate text strings within buffer
* **File Management**: Ability to save files to disk and open files (pass as terminal argument)

## Prerequisites

* **Operating System**: Windows
* **Compiler**: C++20 compatible compiler

## Quick Start

To use this program, compile the files together and simply run the executable. If you'd like to open a file, you're going to have to use terminal to pass the file you'd like to open as an argument.
